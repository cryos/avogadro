ABOUT

	Wiiusecpp is a C++ wrapper for the wiiuse C library for Nintendo Wii remotes.  The library
	creates class wrappers around the wiiuse wiimote data structures and provides member functions
	to peform access to those data structures.  Mangement of the wiimote pointers and passing them
	to the wiiuse library is handled by the class libraries.  The library attempts to create a
	useful set of classes and class heirarchy for the wiimote functionality including motion sensing,
	IR tracking, and the expansion controllers supported by wiiuse (nunchuk, classic, Guitar Hero 3).

	It is expected that the classic and GH3 controllers will work correctly but I don't own either
	so I have not tested them. I have only tested wiiusecpp and wiiuse on a linux system so while
	I expect this to work cross platform there may be some minor fixes required.  Please email me
	if you can verify operation on windows.  If you want to use wiiusecpp on OS X and you are a
	developer get in contact with para over at wiiuse.net -- wiiuse does not yet run on it.

	The original motivation for the creation of this library was to facilitate a Python SWIG wrapper
	for the wiiuse library pywii (also available from http://missioncognition.net/).  I consider this
	a functioning alpha release so while it should operate fine, the API may change based on user
	feedback on the usablility and consistency of the design of either the C++ or Python implementations.

	Distributed under the GPL and LGPL.

LICENSE

	There are two licenses for wiiusecpp (same as wiiuse).  Please read them carefully before
	developing using wiiusecpp under either license.  You may of course at any time switch the
	license you are currently using to the other.

	Briefly, the license options are:

		a) GNU LGPL (modified for non-commercial usage only)
		b) GNU GPL

	PLEASE READ THE LICENSES!

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

		Developer of a fine, cross platform, wiimote library without which this library
		would not exist.


DISCLAIMER AND WARNINGS

	I am in no way responsible for any damages or effects, intended or not, caused by this program.

	*** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING ***

	Be aware that writing to memory may damage or destroy your wiimote or expansions.

	*** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING ***

	This program was written using reverse engineered specifications available from wiibrew.org.
	Therefore the operation of this program may not be entirely correct.
	Results obtained by using this program may vary.


AUDIENCE

	This project is intended for developers who wish to include support for the Nintendo Wii remote
	with their third party application.  Please be aware that by using this software you are bound
	to the terms of the GNU GPL.


PLATFORMS AND DEPENDENCIES

	Wiiusecpp should work on both Linux and Windows.
	You will need:

	For Linux:
		- wiiuse library built and installed
		- The kernel must support bluetooth
		- The BlueZ bluetooth drivers must be installed

	For Windows:
		- A compiled wiiuse library which requires:
			- Bluetooth driver (tested with Microsoft's stack with Windows XP SP2)
			- If compiling, Microsoft Windows Driver Development Kit (DDK)


COMPILING

	Linux:
		# make [target]

		If 'target' is omitted then everything is compiled.

		Where 'target' can be any of the following:

			- wiiusecpp
				Compiles libwiiusecpp.so

			- ex
				Compiles wiiusecpp-example

		Become root.

		# make install

		The above command will only install the binaries that you
		selected to compile.

		wiiusecpp.so is installed to /usr/lib
		wiiusecpp-example is installed to /usr/bin

	Windows:
		Should just compile wiiusecpp.cpp making sure that wiiuse.h is available for
		for the include and link wiiuse.lib (in the project directory!).
		
		If somebody comes up with a make file or project file to make a dll under 
		windows let me know and I'll add it to the distribution.


USING THE LIBRARY IN A THIRD PARTY APPLICATION

	To use the library in your own program you must first compile wiiusecpp as a module or add
	wiiusecpp.cpp to your project.  Include wiiusecpp.h in any file that uses wiiusecpp.

	For Linux you must link with wiiusecpp.so ( -lwiiusecpp ).
	For Windows you must link wiiuse.lib.  When your program runs it will need wiiuse.dll.


BUGS

	From wiiuse:  On Windows using more than one wiimote (usually more than two wiimotes) may cause
	significant latency.
