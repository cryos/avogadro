ABOUT 
=====

  The WmAvo plugins takes place in the WiiChem project of the URCA (University
  of Reims, Champagne-Ardenne, France) <http://www.univ-reims.eu/>.
  The project is supported by the region Champagne-Ardenne (FRANCE) (funding aid)
  <http://www.cr-champagne-ardenne.fr/>.

  The WiiChem project has the goal to help learning the chemistry, and facilitate 
  the molecular modeling by the integration of the Wiimote in the chemistry 
  software. Avogadro is the first software used to build the heart of the 
  project (architecture, testing ...).

    For more information about the WiiChem project, 
      see <http://www.univ-reims.fr/wiichem> (in french, english not available).
      
      
  WmAvo is a group of plugins for Avogadro. Its goals are to improve Avogadro by
  the addition of the Wiimote support, and the anaglyph (red/cyan) visualisation.
  The atoms manipulations are realized by the Wiimote.
  The camera manipulations are realized by the Nunchuk.
